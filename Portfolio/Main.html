                    <h3>DSVR</h3>
                    <p>Over the summer of 2023 I created demo for a vitual reality horror game based on the game Dead Space Mobile in Unity. I coded everything myself and created all the assets. I had not taken a course in Unity or C# yet and taught it to myself over the summer. The entire player interface works. All that needs to be done is to create the other levels and the enemies. I will surely work on this more.</p>

                    <p>From september 2023 to april 2024, I was part of an eight person team where we had to create a website for a client. I cant say much about the website but it gave out online tests. I worked on the home page and the results page for the tests. This website used Vue JS</p>

This applications will show the user what a code functions look like in other languages. A for example, a for loop in Java is typed different and works different than one in Python.</p>
